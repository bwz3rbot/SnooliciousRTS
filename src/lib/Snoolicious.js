/*
    [Snoolicious RTS] - Snoolicious Reddit Tool Suite
    
    Instantiates a Snoowrap requester, then genrates helper classes to manage commands.

        - Class contains functions to interact with these services:
            a. MentionBot
                - Listens for username mentions in the inbox
            b. SubMonitorBot
                - Watches a subreddits *new* section for new submissions
            c. CommandBot
                - Follows a single thread to listen for commands
            d. WikiEditor
                - Edits Wiki Pages
                - Has access to SnooMD

        The tasks list is a PriorityQueue that will get the queued messages from the mentions, submissions, and commands queues,
        and dequeue them from their original queue, then re-enqueue them into itself. The priority level is to be defined when
        calling the get* functions. With 0 being highest priority, all tasks will be called first in first out from the tasks queue.
